Linux, macOS and Windows are all supported as your development machine. You can use any web browser to run the project on the web.

> **info** You don't need macOS to build an iOS app with [EAS](/eas). You only need an iOS device to run [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

### Requirements

To use Expo, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [**Node.js** LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended.
  <CALLOUT theme="secondary">
    As Node.js [officially states](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), "Production applications
    should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases". You can install Node.js using a version
    management tool (such as `nvm` or `volta` or any other of your choice) to switch between
    different Node.js versions.
  </CALLOUT>
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) (for Linux or macOS users).

After installing Node.js, you can use `npx` to bootstrap a new app:

<Terminal cmd={['# npx is part of Node.js', '$ npx create-expo --template']} />

### Recommended tools

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for faster and more reliable dependency management. Use this instead of `npm` and `npx`.
- [VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [VS Code Expo Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=expo.vscode-expo-tools) for easier debugging and app config autocomplete.
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows) (the default terminal in VS Code) or Bash via WSL for developers who prefer Windows.

Yarn users can bootstrap a new app using the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ yarn create expo']} />

### Expo CLI

[Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/) is part of the `expo` package, and you can use it by leveraging `npx` &mdash; a Node.js package runner.

<Terminal cmd={['# Start the development server', '$ npx expo']} />

For example, to see a list of available commands in Expo CLI, open the terminal on your development machine and run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['# See a list of available commands in Expo CLI', '$ npx expo -h']} />
