The [`@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin) library provides different ways such as Firebase and Google API to integrate Google authentication in your Expo app. It also provides native sign-in buttons and supports various authentication methods (such as standard, with server-side validation and offline access). You can use the library in your project by adding the [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) in the [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/). This guide provides additional information on how to configure the library for your project and different steps might be required depending on the authentication method you choose.

## Prerequisites

`@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` requires [custom native code](/workflow/customizing/) and cannot be used with Expo Go. Before proceeding, you can either use:

- Xcode or Android Studio to build your project locally (see [Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/) for more information)
- [Development builds](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/)

## Installation

For instructions on how to install the library and add the config plugin in the app config:

## Configure Google project for Android and iOS

Below are instructions on how to configure your Google project for Android and iOS.

### Android

#### Upload app to Google Play Store

We recommend that you upload the app to the Google Play Store once your app is not in production yet. It is not necessary to upload the complete app if your project is still in the development process. Upload a single instance of your app. This will allow you to sign your app with the required certificates such as SHA-1 certificate fingerprint. It is required when configuring the Google project for Android. To learn more about app submission the process, see the guides below in the order they are specified:

<BoxLink title="Create your first EAS Build" href="/build/setup/" />

<BoxLink title="Build your project for app stores" href="/deploy/build-project/" />

<BoxLink
  title="Manually upload Android app for the first time"
  href="https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission"
/>

Once you've uploaded your app, you have the option to provide SHA-1 certificate fingerprint value when asked while configuring Google project. There are two values that you can provide from:

- Fingerprint of the **.apk** you built (on your machine or using EAS Build). You can find the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint in the Google Play Console under **Release** > **Setup** > **App Integrity** > **Upload key certificate**.
- Fingerprint of a production app downloaded from the play store. You can find the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint in the Google Play Console under **Release** > **Setup** > **App Integrity** > **App signing key certificate**.

#### With Firebase

For more instructions on how to configure your Google project for Android with Firebase:

/>

#### With Google API

For more instructions on how to configure your Google project for Android with Google API:

<BoxLink
  title="Google API"
  href="https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin/blob/master/docs/android-guide.md#1b---if-youre-not-using-firebase"
/>

### iOS

#### With Firebase

For more instructions on how to configure your Google project for iOS with Firebase:

<BoxLink
  title="Firebase"
  href="https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin/blob/master/docs/get-config-file.md"
/>

#### With Google API

For iOS, if you are using Google API instead of Firebase, you'll need to generate OAuth client id. Follow the instructions below to generate the client id:

<BoxLink
  title="Google API"
  href="https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin/blob/master/docs/get-config-file.md#without-firebase"
/>

After you have created the iOS client id, you'll also need to provide the iOS URL scheme value in the app config. You can find the value in the Google API console under **API and Services** > **Credentials** > **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** > **name of your iOS client id** > **Additional information** > **iOS URL scheme**.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Getting iOS URL scheme value from Google API console."
  src="/static/images/ios-url-scheme.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

Then, add the iOS URL scheme value in the app config under [`ios.infoPlist`](/versions/latest/config/app/#infoplist) as shown below:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      /* @hide ...*/ /* @end */
      "infoPlist": {
        "CFBundleURLTypes": [
          {
            "CFBundleURLSchemes": ["com.googleusercontent.apps.17898xxxxxx-xxxxxqhqj0exxxxxpl03xxx"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Upload google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist to EAS

If you are using the Firebase method for Android and iOS (as shared below), you'll need to upload **google-services.json** and **GoogleService-Info.plist** to EAS and them to **.gitignore** to avoid checking them in the repository.
