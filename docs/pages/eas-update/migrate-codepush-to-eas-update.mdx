Transition a [bare](/bare/hello-world/) React Native project with CodePush to use EAS Update. This guide assumes that you are using the default React Native project structure.

## Prerequisites

<Collapsible summary="An Expo user account">

EAS Update is available to anyone with an Expo account, regardless of whether you pay for EAS or use our free tier. You can sign up at [https://expo.dev/signup](https://expo.dev/signup).

Learn more about different plans and benefits at [EAS pricing](https://expo.dev/pricing).

<Step label="1">
## Uninstall CodePush

To avoid conflicts and unexpected behavior, it's recommended to uninstall CodePush if you're using EAS Update. This is because your app could periodically fetch updates from both services, leading to issues, especially if you're using different configurations for each service.

Remove the CodePush SDK from your project by uninstalling the `react-native-code-push` package:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm uninstall react-native-code-push']} />

You'll also need to remove CodePush references from JS and native code. Follow this [guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/1101#issuecomment-350204507) for more detailed instructions.

</Step>

<Step label="2">
## Ensure `app.json` exists

Ensure that your project has an `app.json` file. If you don't have one, you can create one by running the command:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    "# If app.json doesn't exist, create a basic one",
    '[ -f app.json ] || echo "{}" > app.json',
  ]}
/>

</Step>

<Step label="3">
## Install the `expo` package

Install the `expo` package by running the command:

<Terminal cmd={['npx install-expo-modules@latest']} />

If the command fails, follow the installation instructions [here](/bare/installing-expo-modules/#manual-installation)

</Step>

<Step label="4">
## Turn off resource bundle signing (XCode 14+ only)

In Xcode 14 and higher, resource bundles are signed by default, which requires setting the development team for each resource bundle target.
To resolve this issue, downgrade to an older Xcode version using the `image` field in `eas.json`, or turn off signing resource bundles in your Podfile. See this [example here](https://expo.fyi/r/disable-bundle-resource-signing).

</Step>

<Step label="5">
## Follow the Getting Started guide

We have completed all the steps specific to a CodePush and bare React Native project. Follow the steps in [the main guide](/eas-update/getting-started) to complete your setup.

> You may need to edit some of the code `eas update:configure` generates depending on how you build and run your project. See [Updating bare app](/bare/updating-your-app) for more details about the native changes.
